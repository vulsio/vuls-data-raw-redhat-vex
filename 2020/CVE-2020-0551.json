					"text": "A flaw was found in Intel's microprocessors. Intel microprocessors contain an implementation weakness that allows for an 'inverse MDS' style attack to be performed during store operations (writes to memory) and are stuffed maliciously into microarchitectural buffers from which unsuspecting victim code will later (speculatively) execute them. This allows an attacker to control and steer (speculative) execution, possibly allowing them to exploit gadgets in existing code to leak sensitive data. The highest threat from this vulnerability is to data confidentiality.",

Unlike the L1TF microarchitectural issue, no additional CVE have been assigned at this time to cover operating systems or vmm/hypervisor specific implementations.\n\nAs this CVE is a flaw in specific hardware, not the operating system kernel, and operating system mitigations are already applied, Red Hat does not list the Red Hat Enterprise Linux kernel package as “affected” by this CVE.\n\nThis does not imply that the flaw can not be exposed on systems running Red Hat Enterprise Linux on vulnerable hardware, only that the flaws exist in the hardware implementation and no additional changes are deemed necessary or practical to address this flaw at the software layer. \n\nExisting mitigations released in Red Hat Enterprise Linux in response to Spectre V1 (https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/speculativeexecution), L1TF (https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/L1TF) and MDS (https://access.redhat.com/security/vulnerabilities/mds) should already provide significant barrier against exploitation of this attack vector and no new mitigation is planned at this time.",
