An attacker must have access to the image source and be positioned to intercept or modify images during their transmission, which limits the attack surface to environments with insecure or untrusted network configurations. Additionally, the vulnerability only impacts Ironic when it is configured to convert images to raw format for streaming, making it a less common scenario. The absence of checksum validation could compromise image integrity, but it does not grant direct control over the system or immediate escalation of privileges, hence the moderate classification.",
